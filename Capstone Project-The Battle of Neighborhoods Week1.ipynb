    "Selangor also known by its Arabic honorific Darul Ehsan, or \"Abode of Sincerity\", is one of the 13 states of Malaysia. It is on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and is bordered by Perak to the north, Pahang to the east, Negeri Sembilan to the south and the Strait of Malacca to the west. Selangor surrounds the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, both of which were previously part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state capital of Selangor is Shah Alam and its royal capital is Klang. Petaling Jaya and Subang Jaya received city status in 2006 and 2019, respectively.Selangor is one of four Malaysian states that contain more than one city with official city status; the others are Sarawak, Johor, and Penang.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of Selangor has the largest economy in Malaysia in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), with RM 239.968 billion (roughly US$55.5 billion) in 2015, comprising 22.6 percent of the country's GDP. It is the most developed state in Malaysia, and has the largest population and the lowest poverty rate in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kuala Lumpur is the capital of Malaysia. Its modern skyline is dominated by the 451m-tall Petronas Twin Towers, a pair of glass-and-steel-clad skyscrapers with Islamic motifs. The towers also offer a public skybridge and observation deck. The city is also home to British colonial-era landmarks such as the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and the Sultan Abdul Samad Building\n",
    "\n",
    "Kuala Lumpur is the cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia. It is also home to the Parliament of Malaysia and the official residence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Istana Negara. It first developed as a town serving the tin mines of the region circa 1857, before it became the capital of Selangor in 1880 until 1978, and the capital of Malaya before the formation of Malaysia. The city remained the seat of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government until these were relocated to Putrajaya in early 1999. However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in Kuala Lumpur."
